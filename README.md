# Horiseon Refactoring Code Project

## Description 
The objective was to refactor the website code base and optimize it for accessbility standards. The standard is 
WHEN I view the source code THEN I find semantic HTML elements 
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
