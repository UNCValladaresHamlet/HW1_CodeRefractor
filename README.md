# Horiseon Refactoring Project

## Description 
The objective was to refactor the website code base and optimize it for accessbility standards. That was done by changing the title element to have a descriptive title related to the company. Organizing the source code to have semantic HTML elements and have the heading attributes fall in sequential order. The image elements also have accessible alt attributes as well.
